# access-request-api

This API is developed as part of a pilot project for a national application platform for applying access to restricted
data or expressing interest in unpublished data. The goal is to simplify and standardize the process for both data
providers and users, ensuring that valuable data can be shared in a secure and controlled manner.

Users can submit requests directly via data.norge.no or through organizationsâ€™ data catalogs. The solution also allows
users to register interest in data that is not yet ready for sharing. This provides data providers with insights into
demand and a better basis for assessing whether they should prioritize making these data available.
